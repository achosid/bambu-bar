**Your Bambu Lab printer, one click away in the menu bar.**

Bambu Bar is a native macOS app that shows your 3D printer's progress, temperatures and filament without opening Bambu Studio or Bambu Handy. Glance at the menu bar for percent and time left, click for everything else, or keep a widget on your desktop.

Built with Swift and SwiftUI. No account, no cloud service, no analytics.

## This fork

A personal fork of [rolottr/bambu-bar](https://github.com/rolottr/bambu-bar) for ad-hoc signed builds and for watching printers from away from home over Tailscale. Tested with an H2D (with AMS) and an A1 mini on a separate IoT VLAN; both connect with the certificate authorities that already ship with the app. What it changes:

- **No desktop widget.** The widget extension, its app group and the Widgets page are gone, so the app builds and runs fully without a Developer ID, and it never touches a group container. Mentions of the widget, its snapshot and the Widgets shortcut further down describe upstream, not this fork (here `⌘1` – `⌘4` are Printer, Filament, Settings, About).
- **Hostnames.** The address field takes an IP address or a hostname. Discovery still follows a printer to a new DHCP address, but only when the saved address is a plain IP; a hostname is kept as entered, and a printer that isn't announcing keeps its saved address and keeps reconnecting.
- **Network changes.** The app reconnects about a second and a half after this Mac changes networks (Wi-Fi, tethering, a hotel network, a VPN coming up) instead of waiting out its back-off, waits quietly while there's no network at all, and spreads its retries (2 s up to 30 s, with jitter).
- **LAN or remote.** While connected, the status shows how the printer is reached: **On LAN**, or **Remote via Tailscale** (**Remote via VPN** for other tunnels), from the interface the connection actually uses. `--probe` prints it too.
- **Building from an iCloud-synced folder.** `build.sh` strips the extended attributes iCloud adds, which `codesign` otherwise rejects.

Ad-hoc signed builds look like a new app to the keychain after every rebuild, so macOS asks once per printer to let Bambu Bar read its access code. Choose **Always Allow**.

### Printers on another subnet

Printers announce themselves with UDP broadcasts, which don't cross subnets or VLANs. If your printers live on an IoT network, they won't appear in the list: choose **Enter address manually** and type the printer's IP address, its serial number (in the device information on the printer's screen, or in Bambu Studio's Device tab) and the access code. The router has to allow this Mac to reach the printer on TCP port 8883.

### Away from home with Tailscale

The app connects to the saved address directly, so a [Tailscale subnet router](https://tailscale.com/kb/1019/subnets) at home is all it needs. Only TCP 8883 to each printer is used.

1. **Fix the printers' addresses.** Give each printer a DHCP reservation on your router.
2. **Advertise the printers from a machine at home** that's on your tailnet and can reach them on port 8883 (a NAS, a Raspberry Pi). Advertising just the printers keeps the rest of the network off the tailnet:
   ```sh
   tailscale set --advertise-routes=192.168.20.50/32,192.168.20.51/32
   ```
   (Use your printers' addresses, or the whole subnet such as `192.168.20.0/24`. On Linux, enable IP forwarding as the Tailscale docs describe; leave subnet SNAT on so the router needs no route back.)
3. **Approve the routes** for that machine in the Tailscale admin console (Machines → … → Edit route settings).
4. **On this Mac**, keep **Use Tailscale subnets** on in the Tailscale menu.
5. Optionally, restrict your Mac to `tcp:8883` on those addresses in the tailnet policy file.

Away from home, the printers show **Connected · Remote via Tailscale**. At home the Mac also uses the Tailscale route (it's more specific than the default route), so the status says Remote there too and printer access depends on the subnet router being up; turn **Use Tailscale subnets** off at home if you'd rather go direct.

If a network you join uses the same addresses as your printers, the Mac may reach some other device instead. The printer's certificate check refuses it (it must chain to Bambu Lab and name the printer's serial), the status shows **Certificate not trusted**, and the app tries again on the next network change.

## Why this app?

The printer is in another room, and the slicer is a big app to keep open just to see how long is left. Bambu Bar keeps the answer in the menu bar: **64% · 1h 02m**. Click it and a panel shows the job, the stage, temperatures, the spool in use and how much filament is left, with pause, stop, light and speed controls right there.

It talks to the printer directly over your network, the same way Bambu Studio does in LAN mode, so it works with the printer still bound to your Bambu account and nothing goes through a cloud.

## Features

| | What you get |
| --- | --- |
| **Menu bar** | A printer glyph that fills as the print grows, with progress and time left beside it (or just one, or only the icon), and a pause or alert mark when the printer needs you. |
| **Panel** | The job, its stage ("Heating hotend", "Paused: filament ran out"), percentage, layers, time left and finish time; nozzle, bed and chamber temperatures; AMS spools with what's left and the humidity; printer errors in plain English. |
| **Controls** | Pause, resume, stop (with a confirmation), print speed (Silent, Standard, Sport, Ludicrous) and a chamber light switch. |
| **Drawn to match** | Each printer is drawn as its model, with the part growing in the colour of the filament in use: the P2S/P1S/X1 enclosure, the wider dual-nozzle H2, the open P1P frame, the A1's arch with its AMS Lite, the A1 mini. |
| **Window** | A larger view plus fans, nozzle, door, network, storage and firmware; a Filament page with every spool; a Widgets page that tours every widget size and state. |
| **Several printers** | Bambu Bar watches all of them at once. Switch from the printer name at the top of the panel or the window's sidebar, and choose which one the menu bar shows (or let it pick whichever is busy). |
| **Desktop widgets** | Small, medium and large, one per printer if you like, counting down between updates. |
| **Notifications** | Print finished, failed or canceled, paused (filament runout and the like), new printer errors, and optionally when a print starts. |
| **Easy setup** | Finds printers on your network and reads the access code from Bambu Studio or OrcaSlicer, on this Mac or from a settings file copied from another one. |
| **Mac integration** | Open at Login, no Dock icon while it lives in the menu bar (the icon and menus appear while its window is open), keyboard shortcuts, and it follows the printer when DHCP gives it a new address. |

## Getting started

### Requirements

- **macOS 26 Tahoe or later**, Apple silicon or Intel.
- A Bambu Lab printer on the same local network as the Mac.

### Install and connect

1. Download the latest `Bambu-Bar-<version>-macos.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/rolottr/bambu-bar/releases), unzip it and move **Bambu Bar.app** to your Applications folder. Or [build it yourself](#building-from-source).
2. Open it. The window lists the printers it finds on your network; pick yours.
3. The **access code** usually fills itself in: if Bambu Studio or OrcaSlicer on this Mac has used the printer, Bambu Bar reads the code from its settings. Slicer on another Mac? Drop that Mac's `~/Library/Application Support/BambuStudio/BambuStudio.conf` onto the setup page. Otherwise read it off the printer: **Settings → Network** on its screen shows the 8-character **Access Code**.
4. Click **Connect**. The menu bar starts showing progress as soon as the printer reports in.

The access code is stored in your keychain and only ever sent to the printer. If it changes later (after a factory reset, say) and the slicer has the new one, Bambu Bar offers to use it.

Closing the window keeps Bambu Bar running in the menu bar without a Dock icon. Opened at login, it starts quietly in the menu bar; open it from Spotlight or the menu bar to see the window. **Add Printer…** in the printer picker or in Settings adds another printer.

### About downloaded builds

Builds on the [Releases](https://github.com/rolottr/bambu-bar/releases) page are **universal, Developer ID signed and notarized by Apple**, so they open normally after you download them. Builds you make yourself without a Developer ID certificate, and the artifacts of the [Actions](https://github.com/rolottr/bambu-bar/actions/workflows/build.yml) workflow, are ad-hoc signed: they run on the Mac that built them, but the desktop widget only loads in a Developer ID signed copy.

### Controlling prints

Reading status works in any mode. Pause, resume, stop and speed changes are accepted only when the printer is in **LAN Only** mode with **Developer Mode** on (printer screen → Settings → Network). That's Bambu Lab's rule for third-party apps; without it the printer refuses the command and Bambu Bar says so (the buttons show a lock). The chamber light works either way.

## Desktop widgets

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/assets/widgets.webp" width="480" alt="The Bambu Bar widget morphing from small to medium to large while a print plays through printing, paused and finished">
</p>

- **Small:** a progress ring with the percentage, time left, the filament going in, and the finish time and layers. Paused, it says why; finished, how long ago and how long it took; idle, the temperatures and loaded spools.
- **Medium:** the drawn printer with the part growing, the job and its progress, finish time, layers and temperatures.
- **Large:** everything: temperature tiles, every AMS spool with what's left, the newest error in plain words and how the last print went.

To add one, right-click the desktop and choose **Edit Widgets…**, search for **Bambu Bar** and drag the size you want onto the desktop or into Notification Center. With more than one printer, right-click a widget and choose **Edit "Printer"** to pick which printer it shows; a widget left empty follows the menu bar printer.

The widget shows what the app last saw, so keep Bambu Bar running (Open at Login does that). While a print runs, the widget projects progress and time left forward on its own between updates.

## Compatibility

| Printer | Status |
| --- | --- |
| **P2S** | Development printer; verified with firmware **01.03.00.00** and an AMS 2 Pro. |
| **X1, P1, A1, H2 families** | Same LAN protocol and certificate authorities; implemented, not verified on hardware. |

The printer can be in cloud mode or LAN Only mode; controls need LAN Only with Developer Mode (see above). The camera is not shown.

If you try another model, [open an issue](https://github.com/rolottr/bambu-bar/issues) with the model, firmware, macOS version and what worked. Run `--probe` (below) for a report; remove the serial number and access code before posting it.

## How it works

Bambu printers run an MQTT broker on port 8883. Bambu Bar connects to it over TLS 1.2 (the P2S doesn't answer TLS 1.3), signs in as `bblp` with the access code, and accepts the printer only if its certificate chains to Bambu Lab's own certificate authorities, which ship with the app, *and* is issued to the printer's serial number, so no other device on the network can collect the code. It asks once for a full report and then merges the changes the printer sends about once a second.

Printers announce themselves on UDP port 2021; that's how Bambu Bar lists them during setup and notices when one moves to a new address. The widgets read a snapshot the app writes to an app group container on this Mac.

## Privacy and local storage

No account, no analytics, no cloud. Bambu Bar talks only to your printers on your local network.

- **Printers (address, serial, name) and preferences:** local macOS user defaults.
- **Access codes:** your login keychain.
- **Last prints** (for "Last: …" and finish times, only what the app saw while running): `~/Library/Application Support/Bambu Bar/history.json`.
- **Widget snapshot:** `~/Library/Group Containers/<team>.dev.rolottr.BambuBar/printers.json`.

## Building from source

Requirements: Xcode 26 or later and [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) (`brew install xcodegen`). No third-party Swift packages.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rolottr/bambu-bar.git
cd bambu-bar
./scripts/build.sh               # build/App.noindex/Bambu Bar.app (universal, release)
./scripts/install.sh             # copy to /Applications and open it
./scripts/install.sh --build     # rebuild first
```

`build.sh` generates the Xcode project from `project.yml`, builds the app and its widget extension, and signs both with the first **Developer ID Application** identity in your keychain (override with `SIGN_IDENTITY=…`; set `TEAM_ID` to match its team, which names the app group the widget shares). Without one the app is signed ad hoc and works without the widget. `CONFIG=Debug` and `ARCHS=arm64` are available. Builds go into a `.noindex` folder so Spotlight and Launchpad only ever find the installed copy.

### Package and notarize a release

```sh
NOTARY_PROFILE=<profile> ./scripts/package.sh
```

This makes a universal release build signed with Developer ID, the Hardened Runtime and a secure timestamp, submits it to Apple's notary service, staples the ticket and checks it with Gatekeeper, then writes `build/Bambu-Bar-<version>-macos.zip` and its SHA-256 checksum. The profile is a [notarytool keychain profile](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/customizing-the-notarization-workflow) (`xcrun notarytool store-credentials`). Without `NOTARY_PROFILE` it packages the signed build without notarizing.

To verify a download, run this next to both files:

```sh
shasum -a 256 -c Bambu-Bar-1.0.0-macos.zip.sha256
```

The [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/build.yml) builds and uploads an ad-hoc signed ZIP on pushes and pull requests. It does not sign, notarize or publish a release.

### Developing without a printer

- `--demo [printing|preparing|paused|finished|failed|idle|offline|unconfigured]` runs a simulated P2S; add `--fleet` for three printers. Nothing is saved and no network is used.
- `scripts/emulator/printer.py` runs a pretend P2S on `127.0.0.1:8883` (needs `brew install mosquitto`): a TLS MQTT broker that replays a real P2S report, then prints, heats and obeys pause, resume, stop, speed and light. Connect with
  `"build/App.noindex/Bambu Bar.app/Contents/MacOS/Bambu Bar" --connect 127.0.0.1 22E00EMULATOR0 12345678 --insecure-tls`
- `--probe <ip> <serial> <access-code>` connects to a real printer from Terminal and prints what it reports.
- `scripts/showcase.sh <dir>` screenshots the panel, window and widgets in each demo state; `scripts/make-readme-animations.sh` renders the animations above, offscreen, from the demo printer.
- `scripts/make-hms.py` regenerates the bundled error texts.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `⌘1` – `⌘5` | Printer, Filament, Widgets, Settings, About. |
| `⌘R` | Ask the printer for a full report. |
| `⌘L` | Turn the chamber light on or off. |
| `⌘,` | Settings. |

The **Printer** menu also switches printers, adds one, and pauses, resumes or stops the print.
